# Cart Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.
This is a working model of cart services for a basic e-commerce portal. The landing page shows the list of orders, we can see the order detail for a specific order by clicking on the order tile. 
In Order details page, it is also possible to add / remove the existing products, add (brand) new products and to place the order (dummy - only consoling the cart for now).
The idea is to give more emphasize on the functionality than the UX. Strong use of type casting was intended, we created some interfaces as helpers to type casting and a service file to help data mapping.
We tried out a few material modules. Form optimization to be done.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
